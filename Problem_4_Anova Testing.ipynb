    "> *\"Generate three independent samples, each of size 30, from normal distributions with means 0, 0.5, and 1, each with standard deviation 1. Perform a one-way ANOVA to test whether all three means are equal. Perform three independent two-sample t-tests: samples 1 vs 2, 1 vs 3, and 2 vs 3. Compare the conclusions and write a short note on why ANOVA is preferred over running several t-tests.\"*\n",
