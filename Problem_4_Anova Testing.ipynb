Perform a one-way ANOVA to test whether all three means are equal. Perform three independent two-sample t-tests: samples 1 vs 2, 1 vs 3, and 2 vs 3.

    "## Comparing the Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing the one-way ANOVA allows for a single overarching evaluation across the three samples to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference in the sample means. When the null hypothesis is rejected, this implies that at least one of the sample means differs from the others. However, the ANOVA does not identify which specific sample mean differs from the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "To gain more precise insight, pairwise comparisons can be incorporated following a significant ANOVA result, where the sample means are compared to one another in pairs. Post-hoc tests such as Tukey's HSD, Bonferroni correction, or Scheffé's method are preferred over simple pairwise independent two-sample *t*-tests because they control for the inflation of Type I error that occurs when performing multiple comparisons. By comparing the results of the pairwise comparisons and the one-way ANOVA side by side, it is possible to evaluate whether the conclusions are consistent across both methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results can be considered consistent, and indicative of meaningful differences between specific sample means, when the ANOVA rejects the null hypothesis and one or more of the pairwise comparisons also reject their respective null hypotheses. When the ANOVA does not reject the null hypothesis, pairwise comparisons should generally not be conducted, as performing them increases the risk of false positive findings.\n"

    "## Why ANOVA Is Preferred Over Several *t*-Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the increased likelihood of Type I errors when performing several *t*-tests, it is preferable to use one-way ANOVA when comparing the means of more than two samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *t*-tests are implemented using a fixed significance level (for example, $\\alpha = 0.05$) for each individual test. When multiple *t*-tests are carried out, the likelihood of a false positive—in terms of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis—increases beyond the chosen significance level. This issue is known as **Type I error inflation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue of **Type I error inflation** can be addressed by using one-way ANOVA, as it is a single test that assesses all sample means simultaneously while maintaining control of the Type I error rate at the specified significance level. This makes ANOVA a more robust and reliable approach for detecting differences when comparing more than two sample means.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, ANOVA is preferred for the initial evaluation, with pairwise *t*-tests then implemented as a secondary step to identify specific differences between sample means."
