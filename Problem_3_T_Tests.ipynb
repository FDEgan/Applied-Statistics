    "**Problem:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Generate two samples of size 100, one from the standard normal distribution and one from a normal distribution with mean difference `d` and standard deviation 1. For each mean difference `d = 0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 1.0`, repeat the simulation 1,000 times, run an independent two-sample *t*-test at the 5% significance level, and record the proportion of times the null hypothesis is not rejected. Plot this proportion against `d` and explain how the Type II error rate changes as the difference in means increases.\"\n",

    "  \\alpha = 0.05\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "  This means that, under repeated testing when the null hypothesis is true, we expect it to be incorrectly rejected in approximately 5% of cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the null hypothesis is **not rejected** even though it is false, this is known as a **Type II error**.  \n",
