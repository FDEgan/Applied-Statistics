Plot this proportion against `d` and explain how the Type II error rate changes as the difference in means increases.\"\n",

    "  $$\n",
    "  \\alpha = 0.05\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "  This means that, under repeated testing when the null hypothesis is true, we expect it to be incorrectly rejected in approximately 5% of cases.\n",
