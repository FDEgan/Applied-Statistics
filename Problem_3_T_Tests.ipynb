For each mean difference `d = 0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 1.0`, repeat the simulation 1,000 times, run an independent two-sample *t*-test at the 5% significance level, and record the proportion of times the null hypothesis is not rejected. Plot this proportion against `d` and explain how the Type II error rate changes as the difference in means increases.\"\n",
