    "## Interpreting the Estimated Probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "The table above shows both the exact and simulated probabilities of correctly identifying all milk-first cups purely by random guessing,that is, achieving a perfect score in each experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Interpretation of the Results\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Original 8-cup experiment:**  \n",
    "  The exact probability of a perfect score is roughly 1/70 or 0.0143 for the Original 8 Cup Experiment.  \n",
    "  This means that even with no genuine ability, a participant would, on average, guess all 4 milk-first cups correctly about 1.4% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extended 12-cup experiment:**  \n",
    "  The exact probability decreases to 1/495 or 0.0020 for the Extended 12 Cup Experiment \n",
    "  This means that even with no genuine ability, a participant would, on average, guess all 4 milk-first cups correctly about 0.2% of the time when the number of cups is increased to 12.\n",
    "\n",
    "By increasing the total number of cups from 8 to 12, while keeping the number of milk-first cups fixed at 4, it makes it much harder for a random guesser to pick the correct combination. As a result, the probability of achieving a perfect score by chance becomes much smaller.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, the liklihood of achieving a perfect score in the 12-cup version is over 7 times **less likely** than in the original experiment, under the assumption of Random Guessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Interpreting the p-values\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the null hypothesis (they possess no special ability to distuinguish between Milk First or Tea First), the participant is in essence\n",
    "choosing 4 cups at random from the all cups. A perfect score in this situation is therefore extremely unlikely, and the p-value tells us *how unlikely* it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the scenario that we use a perfect score, as the criteria to detect ability:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Original 8-cup experiment:**  \n",
    "  - The chance of a perfect guess is about 0.014 (1.4%).  \n",
    "  - This is below the 5%/ 0.05 threshold level low enough to denote it as statistically significant.\n",
    "    - This is turn, may indicate an innate ability to actually identify the cups that were Milk First.  \n",
    "  - However, if we were to use the stricter 1%/ 0.01 threshold level, this would not be deemed to be statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extended 12-cup experiment:**  \n",
    "  - The chance of a perfect guess is about 0.002 (0.2%), when the experiment is extended to have 12 cups.   \n",
    "  - This is below both the 5% and 1% levels, meaning a perfect score provides very strong reasoning to believe a participant has an ability to tell the difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Summary of Analysis:** \n",
    "  - Based on the above findings, we would reject the null hypothesis in both experiments, but the extended version provides much stronger evidence, as the original experiment only meets the 5% significance level, while the extended experiment is also significant at the stricter 1% level.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - As the extended experiment results in an extremely small p-value (≈ 0.002), it would still be considered significant even under the more stringent thresholds proposed by Benjamin & Berger (2019), who argued for lowering the traditional 0.05 standard. In the case of a stricter threshold, the original experiment, by contrast, would not meet it.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - However, in standard practice, researchers typically retain the conventional 5% or 1% significance levels, in which case both experiments allow rejection of the null hypothesis, with the extended design providing much stronger evidence.\n",
