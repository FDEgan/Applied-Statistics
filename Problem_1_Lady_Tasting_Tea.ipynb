    "## Interpreting the Estimated Probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "The table above shows both the exact and simulated probabilities of correctly identifying all milk-first cups purely by random guessing,that is, achieving a perfect score in each experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Interpretation of the Results\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Original 8-cup experiment:**  \n",
    "  The exact probability of a perfect score is roughly 1/70 or 0.0143 for the Original 8 Cup Experiment.  \n",
    "  This means that even with no genuine ability, a participant would, on average, guess all 4 milk-first cups correctly about 1.4% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extended 12-cup experiment:**  \n",
    "  The exact probability decreases to 1/495 or 0.0020 for the Extended 12 Cup Experiment \n",
    "  This means that even with no genuine ability, a participant would, on average, guess all 4 milk-first cups correctly about 0.2% of the time when the number of cups is increased to 12.\n",
    "\n",
    "By increasing the total number of cups from 8 to 12, while keeping the number of milk-first cups fixed at 4, it makes it much harder for a random guesser to pick the correct combination. As a result, the probability of achieving a perfect score by chance becomes much smaller.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, the liklihood of achieving a perfect score in the 12-cup version is over 7 times **less likely** than in the original experiment, under the assumption of Random Guessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Interpreting the p-values\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the null hypothesis (they possess no special ability to distuinguish between Milk First or Tea First), the participant is in essence\n",
    "choosing 4 cups at random from the all cups. A perfect score in this situation is therefore extremely unlikely, and the p-value tells us *how unlikely* it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the scenario that we use a perfect score, as the criteria to detect ability:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Original 8-cup experiment:**  \n",
    "  - The chance of a perfect guess is about 0.014 (1.4%).  \n",
    "  - This is below the 5%/ 0.05 threshold level low enough to denote it as statistically significant.\n",
    "    - This is turn, may indicate an innate ability to actually identify the cups that were Milk First.  \n",
    "  - However, if we were to use the stricter 1%/ 0.01 threshold level, this would not be deemed to be statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extended 12-cup experiment:**  \n",
    "  - The chance of a perfect guess is about 0.002 (0.2%), when the experiment is extended to have 12 cups.   \n",
    "  - This is below both the 5% and 1% levels, meaning a perfect score provides very strong reasoning to believe a participant has an ability to tell the difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the above findings, we would reject the null hypothesis in both experiments, but the extended version provides much stronger evidence, as the original experiment only meets the 5% significance level, while the extended experiment is also significant at the stricter 1% level.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the extended experiment results in an extremely small p-value (≈ 0.002), it would still be considered significant even under the more stringent thresholds proposed by Benjamin & Berger (2019), who argued for lowering the traditional 0.05 standard. In the case of a stricter threshold, the original experiment, by contrast, would not meet it.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in standard practice, researchers typically retain the conventional 5% or 1% significance levels, in which case both experiments allow rejection of the null hypothesis, with the extended design providing much stronger evidence.\n",
